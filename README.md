# BarBot Alexa Skill
An Alexa Skill for controlling [BarBot](https://github.com/camm73/BarBot) with your voice using an Amazon Echo.

## Voice Control Features
* Request a cocktail to be made (e.g. "Alexa, tell robot bartender to make me a Gin and Tonic")
* Ask what is on the cocktail menu (e.g. "Alexa, ask robot bartender 'What's on the menu tonight?'"
* Set Alcohol Mode (a mode where BarBot ignores non-alcoholic ingredients) (e.g. "Alexa, tell robot bartender to turn alcohol mode on")
